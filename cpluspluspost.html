		<h3>C++ Projects</h3>

		<p>During my sophomore year at Florida State I created/crafted many small projects using the language C++. Take a look at some of them listed below.
		<br>
		<br>
		The application as stated, was simply a list where you can input items that you need to do. Similar to a written list.
		<br>
		<br>
		However simple it may seem, this app included a scrolling recycler feature and also allowed for items to be deleted upon request. By simply checking the box the user could cross an item out(mark the item as done). And with a simple click of a button the finished items could be removed from the list


		<h5>Technologies:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>- C++</li>
			<li>- Doxygen</li>
			<li>- GitHub</li>
			<li>- README</li>
			<li>- Linux/Unix</li>
			<li>- Data Structures & Algorithims</li>
		</ul>


		<h5>Highest Occuring Character In a String</h5>
		<p>For my first and shortest project I was tasked with finding the character that occured the most in a string. Using simple C++ data structures I was able to find such character.</p>

		<br>
		<h5>Concatenated Primes</h5>
		<p>For my second project, I was tasked with creating a string of concatenated primes given a certain starting point. Using simple functions to create primes I was able to create said strings.</p>

		<br>
		<h5>OSM File Parser</h5>
		<p>My third project involved OSM files. Better known as Open Street Map files. Open Street Map is a open source form of google/apple maps. Thus allowing for people like me to take a look at map file structures. Using regular expression I was able to parse the OSM files given, and output certain data points from the file. Including number of highways and ways.</p>

		<br>
		<h5>Roman Numeral Generator</h5>
		<p>The roman numeral generator takes in a given number and returns it's roman numeral. It also will take in a roman numeral and return it's arabic numeral form. This was another use of a simple algorithim, except this time it involved Roman Numerals.</p>

		<br>
		<h5>Sudoku Solver</h5>
		<p>This project involved the commonly known puzzle Sudoku. Using backtracking and recursion I was able to take a given Sudoku puzzle and return a finished puzzle. Using two-dimensional arrays and other data structues I was abke to accomplish beating the puzzle!!</p>
